# Calculations for my graduate work
This paper performs the usual calculations and table manipulations using the pandas library. As a result of the study, we obtained an index model that aggregates diverse data from seven tables. This model has two metrics - growth and percentage growth by decades.

The index formula was devised to gain a comprehensive understanding of the structure by assembling the puzzle pieces (trade, foreign investment, sociology, migration). inspiration was drawn from both combining the concept of mathematical expectation with ordinary fractions.
